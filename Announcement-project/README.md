# Announcement Text Analysis Project
This project uses deep learning software to classify Rose-Hulman sharepoint emails. It is intended to filter and distribute emails to different categories. 
Currently, the emails is correctly parsed and stored in the data folder. I used the Kaggle tutorial built a paragraph to word function and was able to pass it to word2vec and built my own clusters. It is stored in the Announcement Build Model notebook.

### TODO:
1. Convert each email to vector using word2vec
2. Use KMean to cluster each email instead of words
3. Train a classifier to analyze emails
