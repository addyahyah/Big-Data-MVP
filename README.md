# Setting Up JupyterHub
This tutorial replicates and extends the information in the [JupyterHub PyData 2016](https://github.com/minrk/jupyterhub-pydata-2016/blob/master/JupyterHub.pdf) presentation.

This tutorial runs the server without ssl encryption. For more details on how to adde ssl, read the link above.

## Installation
JupyterHub requires Python 3.3+, so first download the Python 3.5 version of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

In this case, we installed Anaconda3 using root privilege.
```
su
```
Then enter your su password

To set a password for su
```
sudo passwrd
```
To install anaconda do
```
bash anaconda3xxxx.bash
```
When asked, make sure the package will be installed to this directory:
```
/opt/anaconda3/
```
Open .bashrc and root user's .bashrc 
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
vi /home/your_directory/.bashrc
vi /root/.bashrc
```
Then add the bin file path to your in the command line:
```
export PATH=‚Äù$PATH:/opt/anaconda3/bin"
```
Type the following into the command line to install JupyterHub:
```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterhub
```
This line adds the conda-forge channel for package management:
```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```
In order to run Jupyterhub without ssl
```
mkdir /srv/jupyterhub
cd /srv/jupyterhub
jupyterhub --no-ssl
```
## Optional Steps
You do not have to install Jupyter Notebook if you are only running a server, but you could by typing the following:
```
conda install notebook
```
Using minrk's github repo will help you install oauthenticator, dockerspawner, and netifaces:
```
git clone https://github.com/minrk/jupyterhub-pydata-2016 /srv/jupyterhub
cd /srv/jupyterhub
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
### Installing Docker
Install Docker here: [Docker.io](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/)

### Adding Python2 and R to your JupyerHub
Python2:
```
conda create -n py2 python=2 anaconda
source activate py2
ipython kernel install
```
R:
```
conda install -c r r-essentials
conda create -n my-r-env -c r r-essentials
```
For more in-depth information on using R in the Jupyter Notebook environment, check out Christine Doig's blog [Jupyter and Conda for R](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer/jupyter-and-conda-r).

### Adding nbgrader for jupyterhub
```
sudo pip3 install nbgrader
sudo nbgrader extension install --symlink
sudo nbgrader extension activate
```
 For each user who needs to create assignments, they need to enter the last in their command line as well

### Tensorflow with graphics compatibility:
I followed this [Korean link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJTvx0hievk) and installed the tensorflow package. For the record, I do not understand any Korean, all I did was follow the lines he typed.
The official site is [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html#optional-install-cuda-gpus-on-linux)


## Special Instructions for Jupyterflow machine:
To use Graphics card on Tensorflow, type this in command line then start Jupyterhub:
'''
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/cuda/lib64
'''
To serve the hub, type the following in the command line:
```
su
screen
cd /srv/jupyterhub/
jupyterhub --no-ssl
```
Then type Ctrl+a then Ctrl+d to detach the process

The configuration files is stored in the /srv/jupyterhub/ directory as well, for more informatino on config you could read [Minrk's file](http://jupyterhub-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or my project log.
